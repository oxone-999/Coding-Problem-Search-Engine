There are
n
points on a coordinate axis
OX
. The
i
-th point is located at the integer point
x
i
and has a speed
v
i
. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All
n
points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the
i
-th point at the moment
t
(
t
can be non-integer) is calculated as
x
i
+t⋅
v
i
.
Consider two points
i
and
j
. Let
d(i,j)
be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points
i
and
j
coincide at some moment, the value
d(i,j)
will be
0
.
Your task is to calculate the value
∑
1≤i<j≤n
d(i,j)
(the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of points.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
(
1≤
x
i
≤
10
8
), where
x
i
is the initial coordinate of the
i
-th point. It is guaranteed that all
x
i
are distinct.
The third line of the input contains
n
integers
v
1
,
v
2
,…,
v
n
(
−
10
8
≤
v
i
≤
10
8
), where
v
i
is the speed of the
i
-th point.
Output
Print one integer — the value
∑
1≤i<j≤n
d(i,j)
(the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).
