While performing complex market analysis William encountered the following problem:
For a given array
a
of size
n
and a natural number
e
, calculate the number of pairs of natural numbers
(i,k)
which satisfy the following conditions:
1≤i,k
i+e⋅k≤n
.
Product
a
i
⋅
a
i+e
⋅
a
i+2⋅e
⋅…⋅
a
i+k⋅e
is a prime number.
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤10000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
e
(1≤e≤n≤2⋅
10

)
, the number of items in the array and number
e
, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(1≤

)
, the contents of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output the answer in the following format:
Output one line containing the number of pairs of numbers
(i,k)
which satisfy the conditions.
