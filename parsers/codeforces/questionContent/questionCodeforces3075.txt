You are given two sets of integers:
A
and
B
. You need to output the sum of elements in the set
C={x|x=a⊕b,a∈A,b∈B}
modulo
998244353
, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Each number should be counted only once.
For example, if
A={2,3}
and
B={2,3}
you should count integer
1
only once, despite the fact that you can get it as
3⊕2
and as
2⊕3
. So the answer for this case is equal to
1+0=1
.
Let's call a segment
[l;r]
a set of integers
{l,l+1,…,r}
.
The set
A
is given as a union of
n
A
segments, the set
B
is given as a union of
n
B
segments.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
A
(
1≤
n
A
≤100
).
The
i
-th of the next
n
A
lines contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤
10
18
), describing a segment of values of set
A
.
The next line contains a single integer
n
B
(
1≤
n
B
≤100
).
The
i
-th of the next
n
B
lines contains two integers
l
j
and
r
j
(
1≤
l
j
≤
r
j
≤
10
18
), describing a segment of values of set
B
.
Note that segments in both sets may intersect.
Output
Print one integer — the sum of all elements in set
C={x|x=a⊕b,a∈A,b∈B}
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the second example, we can discover that the set
C={0,1,…,15}
, which means that all numbers between
0
and
15
can be represented as
a⊕b
.
