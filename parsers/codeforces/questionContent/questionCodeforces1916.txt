Polycarp was gifted an array
a
of length
n
. Polycarp considers an array beautiful if there exists a number
C
, such that each number in the array occurs either zero or
C
times. Polycarp wants to remove some elements from the array
a
to make it beautiful.
For example, if
n=6
and
a=[1,3,2,1,4,2]
, then the following options are possible to make the array
a
array beautiful:
Polycarp removes elements at positions
2
and
5
, array
a
becomes equal to
[1,2,1,2]
;
Polycarp removes elements at positions
1
and
6
, array
a
becomes equal to
[3,2,1,4]
;
Polycarp removes elements at positions
1,2
and
6
, array
a
becomes equal to
[2,1,4]
;
Help Polycarp determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array
a
to make it beautiful.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case consists of one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of elements that Polycarp has to remove from the array
a
to make it beautiful.
