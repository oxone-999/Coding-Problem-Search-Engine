— Spyofgame, founder of Orzlim religion
A long time ago, Spyofgame invented the famous array
a
(
1
-indexed) of length
n
that contains information about the world and life. After that, he decided to convert it into the matrix
b
(
0
-indexed) of size
(n+1)×(n+1)
which contains information about the world, life and beyond.
Spyofgame converted
a
into
b
with the following rules.
b
i,0
=0
if
0≤i≤n
;
b
0,i
=
a
i
if
1≤i≤n
;
b
i,j
=
b
i,j−1
⊕
b
i−1,j
if
1≤i,j≤n
.
Here
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Today, archaeologists have discovered the famous matrix
b
. However, many elements of the matrix has been lost. They only know the values of
b
i,n
for
1≤i≤n
(note that these are some elements of the last column, not the last row).
The archaeologists want to know what a possible array of
a
is. Can you help them reconstruct any array that could be
a
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
b
1,n
,
b
2,n
,…,
b
n,n
(
0≤
b
i,n
<
2
30
).
Output
If some array
a
is consistent with the information, print a line containing
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. If there are multiple solutions, output any.
If such an array does not exist, output
−1
instead.
