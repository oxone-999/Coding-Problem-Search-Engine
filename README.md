## Features

- Web scraping: The search engine scrapes question data from websites such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef using Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
- TF-IDF algorithm: It implements the TF-IDF algorithm to find potential documents (questions) related to the user's query.
- Web application: The search engine is integrated into a web application built with Node.js and React, allowing users to search for questions and view the results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-engine.git

2. Install dependencies:

- Python dependencies for web scraping: (provide instructions to install Python dependencies)
- Node.js dependencies for the web application: (provide instructions to install Node.js dependencies)

3. Additional setup steps:

- Specify the websites to scrape and configure the scraping process.
- Configure the TF-IDF algorithm parameters and any additional settings.

## Usage

1. Start the web scraping process:

- Run the Python script(s) responsible for scraping the websites.
- Ensure that the scraped data is stored in the appropriate format or database.

2. Start the web application:

- Run the Node.js server to serve the web application.
- Access the web application in a browser and interact with the search functionality.

3. Perform a search:

- Enter a query in the search box.
-  Select the website you want to search
- The search engine will process the query using the TF-IDF algorithm and display relevant questions as results.
